<h1>Who is a FirstThought Expert?</h1>
<p>
FirstThought’s experts are life sciences professionals with backgrounds across the entire life sciences and healthcare ecosystems. They are often people with full- or part-time jobs, who engage with FirstThought as a source of supplemental income and to stay involved in what’s current in their industry.</p><p> Whether they are the CEO of a pharmaceutical or medical device company; a nurse in a community hospital, a reimbursement specialist at a national/regional managed care organization; a physician-scientist discovering new treatments in a particular disease space; or a retired professional from a healthcare regulatory agency, FirstThought’s experts are connected with our clients to discuss topics that are relevant to their work experience.
</p>

<h1>What is Different about being a FirstThought Expert?</h1>
<p>
We recognize your time is valuable, and we’re not the only consulting service through which you can pursue ad hoc consultations and surveys. Here’s why we think you should be a member of FirstThought’s expert network:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>FirstThought’s expert servicing team have strong life sciences backgrounds, which allows them to identify the right projects for you, thus minimizing the amount of consultation opportunities sent your way which are not relevant to your expertise.</li>
  <li>Our turnaround time from initial outreach, to consultation scheduled, to honorarium processed is shorter than other networks due to the number of FirstThought servicing team members assigned to keep each project moving forward.</li>
  <li>FirstThought’s network platform technology uses machine learning to help us (and you) better identify consulting opportunities for which we know you will be a good match.</li>
</ul>
